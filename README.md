Analysing the what cleats the top 100 players are wearing each year

Purpose:
Since a young age, I have always seen the top players where in Nike and Adidas. From 2018-2020, it seemed to me that all the pros were wearing Nikes. However, most recently, I have started to see the emergence of New Balance and especially Puma. So, to prove this true, I have conducted an analysis of what brands the top 100 players are wearing each year.
